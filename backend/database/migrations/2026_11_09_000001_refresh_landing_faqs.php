/**
 * Brings the seeded landing-page FAQs in line with what the system actually
 * does: commuters scan the conductor's QR (they have no QR of their own),
 * registration needs a valid ID and admin approval, SOS was removed, rewards
 * are a free-ride voucher every N rides (no points), Lost & Found is
 * browse-and-claim, and feedback is the in-jeep QR crew rating.
 *
 * FaqSeeder skips once any FAQ exists, so existing databases only get the new
 * copy through this migration (same approach as 2026_11_05_000001). A row is
 * rewritten only while both its question and answer still equal the original
 * seed, so anything an admin edited in FAQ Management is left alone.

            'Press and hold Hold to Hail on the map. Your pickup point is sent to the nearest on-duty CHATCO jeep within 1 km of you, and the hail stays active for 3 minutes. You need to be near the route, and the jeep cannot be on break.'],

            'Why can\'t I see all jeeps on the map?',

            'Can I pay for my companions?',
            'Yes. Tell the conductor how many are riding with you. They add your companions to one payment QR, and you pay the group total in a single GCash payment. Each passenger\'s Student, Senior Citizen, or PWD discount still applies.'],

            'Is my personal data safe?',
